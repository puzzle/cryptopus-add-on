# Cryptopus Add-on
Currently in Development, there is no working build as of yet.
--------
### What's it about
The Add-on's purpose is to access Accounts contained within a specific Cryptopus host.
It is supposed to work similar like [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/de), with the difference that it won't be accessing local ressources but those saved on the mentioned Cryptopus server.

The authentication is handled by an external API.

Currently, we are developing the Firefox version of this Add-On.
